# Competitive Programming

This repository stores the code I’ve written throughout my journey in **Competitive Programming** and **Coding Interview** preparation.

I regularly practice on the following platforms:

- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/)
- [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/)
- [Interview.io](https://interviewing.io/)

Each folder corresponds to problems solved from these platforms, including algorithmic techniques and data structure exercises.
